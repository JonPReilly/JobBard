# JobBard
A personal tool for scraping jobs from various tech-centered job sites, applying to them, and tracking those applications. 

## What is JobBard?
  JobBard is a simple and ongoing tool geared toward finding users a software engingeering job. It works by scraping various tech-centered companies from across the web for job postings. While still a work in progress, JobBard aims to not only give software developers a list of up-to-date jobs but give them a simple web interface to track their application progress with multiple companies at once.
  
## Cool, so another job board?
  No- better. Why?
    Job boards focus on keeping you on their site to view and apply jobs. JobBard finds and links to jobs on **every** site including Stackoverflow, Github, and Google careers to name a few.

## What about application tracking?
  Standard job boards also have a key problem. The application tracking system isn't built for the user. JobBard gives the user a system to track application statuses for jobs (again, from **every** source). This included changing application status (phone interview, on-site, etc), taking down notes, seting up interview times, etc. 
 
 ## What's the chrome extension for?
  The chrome extension further augments applying and tracking applications. It will automatically fill out fields for things such as name, education, race & gender information, etc. All of this user information is stored with your JobBard user account. In addition clicking the submit button automatically begins tracking the application.
